### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

# 1. The line below needs to be commented out (or removed)
```ruby

class CardGame

  # 2. Method definition should have underscores between "check" and "for" and "for" and "Ace"
  def checkforAce(card)
  # 3. Should be a double equals sign rather than a single
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  # 4. "dif" should be "def"
  # 5. Missing comma delimiter in card1 card 2
  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card # 6. Return value should be card1 not card
  else
    return card2
  end

#7. There should only be one end instruction
end
end

def self.cards_total(cards)
  # 8. total needs to be assigned an initial value of zero
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value

    #9. Value of total needs to be interpolated
    #10. Return statement needs to be outside of for loop
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
end

#11. need an additional end statement
#12. Need to remove triple quotation mark
```
